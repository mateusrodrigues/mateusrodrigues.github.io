My personal blog.

**Disclaimer**: the official link to the blog -- [blog.mateus.tech](https://blog.mateus.tech) -- points to an instance of this website that is running on Microsoft Azure due to GitHub Pages not yet supporting SSL for custom domains.

If you want to follow along, a pretty good conversation on this demand has been going on [here](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/156).
