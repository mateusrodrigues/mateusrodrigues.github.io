When Dropbox was first introduced to the world, I became a faithful customer. I loved the service, the idea, the safety and reliability of having my files available both locally and remotely. I no longer had to worry about lengthy backups and system images, anticipating the failure of my hard drive.

Years later, we now have several services that offer free cloud storage -- [OneDrive](http://onedrive.live.com), [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com), [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com), etc. They have each their own free storage caps for you to use to your heart's content. If you want more storage, you can always pay for it. But then I thought: _that's too easy, right!?_

That's when I started researching on services I could install on a VM to turn it into a cloud storage server, and I came across [NextCloud](http://nextcloud.com).
