### Hello, World!

Welcome to my corner of the internet. My name is **Mateus de Morais**, I currently live in **Natal, RN, Brazil** and am an avid **.NET Developer** finding my way through the world of open source. The projects that I'm currently working on range from WPF to ASP.NET Core. I use both a Mac and a PC and do not believe one should choose a side, but live the best of both worlds. My all-time favorite programming language is **C#** -- believe me, it's NOT just a half-step above C.

I'm a college student currently pursuing a degree in **Computer Engineering** and a **Microsoft Student Partner**. I also work on building this start-up with some friends of mine called **iFabric**. It's coming out all right.

My personal hobbies include making music, reading and writing -- both in code and in English. 

If you wish to contact me, please don't hesitate! I got my contact information down in the lower-left corner of the website, enjoy! :smile:
